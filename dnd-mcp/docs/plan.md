# D&D Knowledge Navigator: MVP Plan

## Project Overview

The D&D Knowledge Navigator provides D&D information through natural language queries via Claude's MCP interface. We have already implemented the source attribution system and integrated it with core search tools. The MVP will focus on completing the essential functionality needed for effective use with the Claude desktop client.

- **MCP Integration**

  - Updated `search_all_categories` function with MCP response formatting
  - Added attribution to `verify_with_api` to help validate D&D information
  - Enhanced `check_api_health` with proper attribution
  - Ensured all error paths return properly formatted MCP responses

- **Visual Formatting**

## MVP Completion Status

**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…

All planned features for the MVP have been successfully implemented and tested. The D&D Knowledge Navigator is now ready for use with the Claude desktop client.

## Testing & Validation

The following validation has been performed:

1. **Functionality Testing**

   - Verified all tools return properly formatted responses
   - Ensured attribution is correctly displayed in Claude
   - Tested handling of invalid inputs and error conditions

2. **User Experience Testing**
   - Ran sample queries through Claude desktop client
   - Verified readability and organization of responses
   - Checked that attribution enhances rather than detracts from responses

## Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)

After completing the MVP, future development will focus on:

1. **Enhanced Query Processing**
2. **Cross-Category Integration**
3. **Answer Composition**
4. **Advanced Visual Formatting**
5. **Conversation Flow**

These enhancements will be prioritized based on user feedback from the MVP.
